## What next?

In this project, you have:

- Used the `Translate`{:class="block3extensions"} and `Text to Speech`{:class="block3extensions"} extension blocks to create messages in another language
- Used a `broadcast`{:class="block3events"} block so that the respondent can reply to the message that they receive

Why not explore another Scratch extension, `Video Sensing`{:class="block3extensions"}, in the introductory project, [Grow a tree](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-tree){:target="_blank"}?

If you have already completed [Grow a tree](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/grow-a-tree){:target="_blank"}, try out the [Look after yourself](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/look-after-yourself) projects.

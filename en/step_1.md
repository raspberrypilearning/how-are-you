## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how people are feeling but found it difficult to ask them because you don't speak their language? Make an e-card for family, friends, or peers across the world who speak a different language. Choose a sprite to represent you, and send them a message in their preferred language.

### What you will make

Click on the green flag. When the sprite on the left-hand side stops speaking, click on the sprite on the right-hand side to write a reply in the box displayed. Then, click on the blue tick to translate your message.

## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how people are doing but, because you donâ€™t speak their language, you can't ask them?

Make an e-card for family, friends or peers across the world who speak a different language. Add a selfie so it looks like you're speaking in their mother tongue!

Hey, you'll seem billingual or even trilingual. Impressive!

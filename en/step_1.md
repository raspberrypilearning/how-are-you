## Introduction

Have you ever wondered how people are feeling but, because you donâ€™t speak their language, you can't ask them? Make an e-card for family, friends or peers across the world who speak a different language. Choose a sprite to represent you speaking in their language.

### What you will make

Click the green flag. When the left-hand sprite stops speaking, click the right-hand sprite to write a reply in the box provided. Then click the blue tick to translate your message.
